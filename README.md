modules required: argparse, torch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy, wandb, os

To train a model, run the train.py code of the desired model. Make sure to insert the correct path for the Cityscapes dataset and the desired path for the resulting model to be stored. If not using WandB, comment out any lines with wandb functions.

To visualize some results of a model, you can use the visualize_results notebook. Again fill in the paths to the Cityscapes dataset and the model .pth file and either import the desired model and procesing function or copy them into the code.
